# Memoarr

A Memory Game

In this year’s project, you are asked to implement a memory card game called Memoarrr! as a console
game. Various reviews and discussion of the games can be found on sites such as “The Opinionated
Gamer” or “Board Game Geek”.
The following specification is for the base game but you will also have to program two advanced variants
of the game. In general, there are 25 memory cards that will show a combination of an animal and a
background colour. There are five different animals: crab, penguin, octopus, turtle and walrus and five
different background colours: red, green, purple, blue and yellow for a total combination of 25 cards. The
game can be played with 2-4 players.
In the physical game, the cards are placed face down in a 5 times 5 square but the center position remains
free for the volcano and treasure cards. (Note that means one of the regular animal card is not in the
game). In our adaption, we don’t use volcano or treasure cards but simply leave the center position
empty. The players take turns to uncover a card where the uncovered card has to match the previously
uncovered card’s animal or background colour. The uncovered cards remain on the table face up. If the
player uncovers a card that doesn’t match the previously uncovered card, the player is out of the current
round. A round of play ends with only one player remaining who then wins the current round and
receives 1-4 rubies randomly. If there are no more cards to turn over then the players still in the game
continue to take their turns but lose until only one player is left who wins the round. After the current
round the cards remain in place but are turned face down again. After seven rounds, the game ends and
the player with the most rubies wins. In the physical game there are 3 cards with one ruby, 2 cards with 2
rubies, and 1 card with 3 rubies as well as 1 with 4 rubies.
